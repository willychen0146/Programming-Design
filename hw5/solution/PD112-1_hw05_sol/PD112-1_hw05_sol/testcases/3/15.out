It was a wicked and wild wind blew down the doors to let me in. Shattered windows and the sound of drums. People couldnt believe what Id become. Revolutionaries wait, for my head on a silver plate. Just a puppet on a lonely string. Oh, who would ever want to be king. I hear Jerusalem bells aringin, Roman Cavalry choirs are singing. Be my mirror, my sword and shield, my missionaries in a foreign field. For some reason, I cant explain. I know Saint Peter wont call my name. Never an honest word, but that was when I ruled the world. Ohohoh, ohoh, oh Ohohoh, ohoh, oh Ohohoh, ohoh, oh Ohohoh, ohoh, oh Ohohoh, ohoh, oh. I hear Jerusalem bells a ringin, Roman Cavalry choirs are singin. Be my mirror, my sword and shield, my missionaries in a foreign field. For some reason I cant explain, I know Saint Peter wont call my name. Never an honest word. But that was when I ruled the world. Source LyricFind Lyrics and Compose by Christopher A. J.
