In a bright, cozy village, there lived a cheerful bunny named Toby. Every morning, Toby hopped out of bed with a smile as wide as the river. With a heart full of joy and a skip in his step, he greeted his friends with a sunny "Good morning!" They would often spend the day exploring the lush meadows, playing in the soft grass, and sharing delightful stories. As the sun set, painting the sky in shades of pink and orange, Toby would whisper, "What a wonderful day!" and dream of tomorrow's adventures.
